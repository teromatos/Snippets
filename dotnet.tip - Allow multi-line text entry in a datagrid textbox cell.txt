Allow multi-line text entry in a datagrid textbox cell, or How to capture ctrl+enter in a datagridview textbox cell
	
You can enable Multi-line in the DataGridView by setting the column/cells WrapMode to be True.

The grid's KeyPress event doesn't get called when the editing control is being shown because the editing control gets the keypress event instead.

Hope this helps!
