Affects 
 CrashPlan+, CrashPlanPRO, CrashPlanPROe, all platforms

Summary
 In some cases a large file selection (>1TiB or 1 million files) can cause CrashPlan to run out of memory and crash. Symptoms include:

When opening the desktop application, users see "Can't connect to Backup Engine" message.
Application crashes repeatedly while scanning files.
Unpredictable application behavior.
Adjusting the maximum amount of memory allocated to the CrashPlan service can resolve this. 

Diagnosis
Outlined below is the process for confirming that memory usage is leading to the symptoms described above by looking at the CrashPlan application logs and for raising the maximum amount of memory that CrashPlan has access to. 

Navigate to the log folder for your operating system:
Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\CrashPlan\log
Windows Vista, 7, 8: C:\ProgramData\CrashPlan\Log
Mac OS X: /Library/Logs/CrashPlan
Linux (default): /usr/local/crashplan/log
Solaris (default): /opt/sfw/crashplan/log
Open each service.log.# file in a text editor and look for the phrase "OutOfMemoryError":
[09.23.12 22:33:02.273 ERROR   QPub-BackupMgr       backup42.service.backup.BackupController] OutOfMemoryError occurred...RESTARTING! message=OutOfMemoryError in BackupQueue!

If you this message, adjust the maximum amount of memory that CrashPlan can use at one time.
Resolution
Windows
Stop the backup engine
Open the Start menu
Locate the Notepad program, right-click and select Launch as Administrator
Go to File > Open, and navigate to C:\Program Files\CrashPlan\CrashPlanService.ini
Find the following line in the file: -Xmx512m
Edit to something larger such as 768, 896, 1024, 2048. i.e. -Xmx1024m 
This sets the maximum amount of memory that CrashPlan can use. CrashPlan will not use that much until it needs it. 
As a rule of thumb set about a gigabyte RAM for every terabyte in the file selection. 
For example, if you're backing up 1 terabyte of data set the -Xmx value to 1024 like so: -Xmx1024m
Start the backup engine
Mac OS X
Open the Terminal Application (Using Finder, go to: Applications > Utilities > Terminal)
Stop the backup engine by typing:
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.crashplan.engine.plist
Run the following command to open a command line text editor:
sudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.crashplan.engine.plist
Using the arrow keys on your keyboard, find the line: -Xmx512
Edit to something larger such as 768, 896, 1024, 2048. i.e. -Xmx1024m 
This sets the maximum amount of memory that CrashPlan can use. CrashPlan will not use that much until it needs it. 
As a rule of thumb set about a gigabyte RAM for every terabyte in the file selection. 
For example, if you're backing up 1 terabyte of data set the -Xmx value to 1024 like so: -Xmx1024m
Press Control+X to exit. 
Press Y to confirm the changes.
You'll see the prompt "File Name to Write". Press Return to save to the existing location.
Start the backup engine by typing: 
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.crashplan.engine.plist
Linux / Solaris
Stop the backup engine
Using your favorite Terminal based editor, edit the below line in /usr/local/crashplan/bin/run.conf
Edit to something larger such as 768, 896, 1024, 2048. i.e. -Xmx1024m 
This sets the maximum amount of memory that CrashPlan can use. CrashPlan will not use that much until it needs it. 
As a rule of thumb set about a gigabyte RAM for every terabyte in the file selection. 
For example, if you're backing up 1 terabyte of data set the -Xmx value to 1024 like so: -Xmx1024m
 Start the backup engine
