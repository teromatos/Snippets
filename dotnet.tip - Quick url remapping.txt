How to turn that that ugly URL into something memorable... a.k.a Url Remapping in ASP.NET
Have you ever had some horrific URL that you needed to email, tell someone over the phone or just type yourself? Wouldn’t it be nice if instead of 

http://www.nddnug.net/Meeting.aspx?ID=fa92013d-9d75-43b5-b611-55ce3ec1ea18 

you could just have a little URL http://www.nddnug.net/scottgu.aspx ?  



All it takes is a little magic in the Web.Config:

    <system.web>

      <urlMappings enabled="true">

        <add url="~/scottgu.aspx"

             mappedUrl="~/Meeting.aspx?ID=fa92013d-9d75-43b5-b611-55ce3ec1ea18" />

        </urlMappings>

    </system.web>
