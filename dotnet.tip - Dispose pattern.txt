Component (base class of Control) has the following pattern:

~Component() {
  // I am in the finalizer
  Dispose(/*currently disposing=*/false);
}             

Dispose() {
  // I’ve been told to clean up outside the finalizer
  Dispose(/*currently disposing=*/true);
  
 }

protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing) {
    if (disposing) {
        // do stuff that can only be done from the main thread.
    }
    else {
       // this is the finalizer thread.  Be wary of touching other
       // objects as they may have already finalized. 
    }
   // do cleanup actions that can be done either from the finalizer 
   // thread or the main thread.
}
