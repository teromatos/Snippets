To Disable Dashboard

Launch Terminal, located at /Applications/Utilities.

At the Terminal prompt, enter the following text exactly as shown, then press the return or enter key on your keyboard:
defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES


When the Terminal prompt returns, enter the following text exactly as shown, then press the return or enter key on your keyboard:
killall Dock

The Dock will disappear for a moment. When it returns, Dashboard will no longer be running. The Dashboard icon will remain in the Dock, but clicking on it won't do anything. I recommend keeping the Dashboard Dock icon, in case you wish to use Dashboard in the future.
