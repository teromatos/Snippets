WSS2 WebParts compiled with framework 1.1 on VS2005 7/4/2006 01:50:14 PM

I just prepared my new Dell Latitude D820 (and what a fine machine it is!! Woww!!) and I really wanted to avoid installing the VS2003 and move full time to VS2005 witch is a much nicer and more powerful environment.

In the past I have stumbled over this post from Carlos Segura Sanz, who created a WSS2 F1.1 WebPart Project Template for VS2005. Great work! I used the information from this post to find out how I could  move my VS2003 projects to the VS2005-platform. I puzzled around a bit with this and it turned out to be quite simple, so I thought I post the steps here for your convenience:

1.
Install VS2005
2.
Install .NET Framework 1.1 SDK
3.
Install MsBee.
4.
Open your F1.1 Vs2003 solution with VS2005. The conversion wizard appears.
5.
Let the wizard do it’s thing. Don’t worry, it will make a backup before conversion. Be careful that no file are locked by VSS or something like that.
6.
After the conversion, witch should run without errors, close the solution.
7.
Now go to the folder and subfolder holding your solution, and locate the “.csproj”-file(s) (the C# projectfiles), and open this or these with notepad.
8.
Locate the following line:
<Import Project="$(MSBuildBinPath)\Microsoft.CSharp.targets" />
9.
Paste in the following line in right after the above:
<Import Project="$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\MSBee\MSBuildExtras.Fx1_1.CSharp.targets" />
10.
Save and close the file and reopen the solution with VS2005. Now you should be able to compile your solution with 1.1 Framework.

Hope this helps somebody.
