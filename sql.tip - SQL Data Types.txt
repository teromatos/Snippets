Data Types
In Microsoft® SQL Server™, each column, local variable, expression, and parameter has a related data type, which is an attribute that specifies the type of data (integer, character, money, and so on) that the object can hold. SQL Server supplies a set of system data types that define all of the types of data that can be used with SQL Server. The set of system-supplied data types is shown below.

User-defined data types, which are aliases for system-supplied data types, can also be defined. For more information about user-defined data types, see sp_addtype and Creating User-defined Data Types.

When two expressions that have different data types, collations, precision, scale, or length are combined by an operator: 

The data type of the resulting value is determined by applying the rules of data type precedence to the data types of the input expressions. For more information, see Data Type Precedence.


If the result data type is char, varchar, text, nchar, nvarchar, or ntext, the collation of the result value is determined by the rules of collation precedence. For more information, see Collation Precedence.


The precision, scale, and length of the result depend on the precision, scale, and length of the input expressions. For more information, see Precision, Scale, and Length. 
SQL Server provides data type synonyms for SQL-92 compatibility. For more information, see Data Type Synonyms.
