Download a file requiring login and password

If you're using VB .NET, the following should work:

Dim wc as New System.Net.WebClient
wc.Credentials = New System.New.NetworkCredential("USERNAME","PASSWORD")
wc.DownloadFile("http://www.qwerty.com/myfile.zip","c:\myfile.zip")



Where the command will download the zip file to "c:\myfile.zip" using the specified username and password.

This is assuming you're using VB .NET and the user/password prompt is the standard windows-style popup box.
