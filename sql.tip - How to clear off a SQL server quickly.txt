How to clear off a SQL server quickly...

So I was asked in an online community how to quickly clean off a SQL Server to rebuild a MOSS Farm.  Although it won't clean up and "add-ins" to the system DB's or any security identities, this does a quick and dirty job...

IF object_id('tempdb..#AllDatabases') IS NOT NULL DROP TABLE #AllDatabases

CREATE TABLE #AllDatabases
(
            id          INT IDENTITY,
            name     NVARCHAR(128)
)

DECLARE @dbname   nvarchar(128)
DECLARE @counter  int
DECLARE @maxcount int

INSERT INTO #AllDatabases SELECT name FROM master..sysdatabases WHERE name NOT IN ('tempdb', 'master', 'model', 'msdb')

SET @counter = 1
SELECT @maxcount = MAX(id) FROM #AllDatabases

WHILE @counter <= @maxcount
BEGIN
    SELECT @dbname = name FROM #AllDatabases WHERE id = @counter
    Print 'Deleting DB ' + @dbname
    --Uncomment the next line to enable deleting all User DBs
    --DROP DATABASE @dbname
    SET @counter = @counter + 1
END

IF object_id('tempdb..#AllDatabases') IS NOT NULL DROP TABLE #AllDatabases
