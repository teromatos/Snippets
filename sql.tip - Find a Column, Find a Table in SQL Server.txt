Find a Column, Find a Table in SQL Server
OK, so this isn’t rocket science, but then again some of the best things are the simplest. You can do a lot with the information_schema views in SQL Server. 

Here is a short stored procedure that you can use to find:

a table by its full name 
a table by partial name 
a column by its full name 
a column by its partial name
 It comes in handy for me when I am looking for a field in related tables, or a spec I am reading refers to a field by name but not by the table it is in. Like I said, it is simple, but I have used this type of a proc for a long time. 

Table or Column Finder

CREATE PROCEDURE prFindTableOrColumn
(
	@table_name VARCHAR(128) = NULL,
	@search_data VARCHAR(128) = NULL
)
AS
	
	DECLARE @search1 VARCHAR(128)
	SET @search1 = '%' + @table_name + '%'
	IF @search1 IS NULL
		SET @search1 = '%'
	
	DECLARE @search2 VARCHAR(128)
	SET @search2 = '%' + @search_data + '%'
	IF @search2 IS NULL
		SET @search2 = '%'
	
	SELECT
		c.table_name,
		c.column_name,
		c.data_type,
		c.character_maximum_length,
		c.numeric_precision,
		c.numeric_scale
	FROM	
		information_schema.columns c
		INNER JOIN information_schema.tables t 
			ON c.table_name = t.table_name 
	WHERE
		c.table_name LIKE @search1
		AND c.column_name LIKE @search2
		AND t.table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
	ORDER BY 
		c.table_name,
		c.column_name
