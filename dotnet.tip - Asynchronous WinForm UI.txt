Asynchronous WinForm UI
September 7, 2009 — Gerhard Stephan

When you’re trying to create a WinForm Application that is working asynchronously, you’ll probably in a common failure:

    System.InvalidOperationException occurred
    Message="Cross-thread operation not valid: Control 'MainForm' accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on."
    Source="System.Windows.Forms"

You’ll get this failure, because it’s not allowed to update a UI control from another thread than the thread that has created the control.

A fluent way around this is to use the MethodInvoker class.
Let’s asume that you have a statement like the following one:

    appForm.Text = appInfo; 

Using the MethodInvoker class would look like:

    appForm.Invoke(new MethodInvoker(() => { appForm.Text = appInfo; }));

That’s still a one-liner;-) And with that small hint, you’ll get around such annoying exceptions.
