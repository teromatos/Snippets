Troubleshooting Preferences 
If you believe that corrupt or oddly configured preferences may be causing problems in Adium, the quickest way to rule out these issues is by temporarily creating a new set of preferences and checking if the problem still persists. 

Quit Adium 
Rename the "Adium 2.0" folder to "Adium 2.0-old". 
Rename the com.adiumX.adiumX.plist to com.adiumX.adiumX-old.plist 
Relaunch Adium, and see if your problem persists. 
If that doesn't work, then you may as well revert to your previous preferences. To do this, quit Adium, delete the new "Adium 2.0" folder that Adium created, and rename your "Adium 2.0-old" folder back to "Adium 2.0".
