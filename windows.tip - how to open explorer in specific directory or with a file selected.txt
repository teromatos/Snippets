explorer.exe /e,c:\

/n:  Opens a new window in single-paned (My Computer) view for each item
     selected, even if the new window duplicates a window that is
     already open.

/e:  Uses Windows Explorer view. Windows Explorer view is most similar
     to File Manager in Windows version 3.x. Note that the default view
     is Open view.

/root,<object>:  Specifies the root level of the specified view. The
                 default is to use the normal namespace root (the
                 desktop). Whatever is specified is the root for the
                 display.

/select,<sub object>:  Specifies the folder to receive the initial
                       focus. If "/select" is used, the parent folder
                       is opened and the specified object is selected
