2) Increase the Camera Raw Cache.  The default setting for this cache is 1 GB.  
   Unless you’re using a 3.2 megapixel camera from 2001 this likely won’t be enough.  
   The maximum cache is 50 GB.  I set mine to 30 GB.  Problem solved.  
   I’ve had no issues with LR3 being sluggish in about a week now.  
   Making this change seemed to have the most profound effect on Lightroom 3 performance.  
   To increase the Camera Raw Cache, on a Mac, follow this click string: Lightroom > Preferences > File Handling.  
   At the bottom of the dialogue box you will see “Camera Raw Cache Settings”.
