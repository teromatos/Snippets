How do you find out where the .NET Framework SDK is installed? 

Aaron Stebner to the rescue. The values beneath 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\SxS\FRAMEWORKSDK 
tell you where the SDK is installed. If there's a 7.1 value, you 
know where the .NET 1.1 Framework SDK is installed. If there's an 
8.0 value, you know where the .NET 2.0 Framework SDK is installed. 
The value on the other side of the version number is the location.
