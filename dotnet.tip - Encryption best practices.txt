Encrypt or hash sensitive information before persisting it; decrypt or compare when reading it back
Make cryptography code simple
Best practices:
Never store passwords directly, only hash values
Only decrypt data if absolutely necessary (use a hash where possible)
Use symmetric keys to encrypt and decrypt data across multiple machines
Use Windows DPAPI for cryptography on a single machine without using keys
