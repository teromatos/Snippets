Creating a Web Project somewhere other than wwwroot 
You may not want to store your web projects in the inetpub\wwwroot directory to which Visual Studio .NET defaults.
Here are the steps to create a project in another directory:

Create a physical directory manually. 
Map the newly created directory to a virtual directory. 
When you create the project using Visual Studio .NET, the wizard asks you to type the path of the virtual 
directory on your machine (the default is http://www.localhost/WebApplication1). To rename the application 
and to have the application source files stored in the new virtual directory, simply 
type http://www.localhost/<MyVirtualDirectory> into the project's Location box.
