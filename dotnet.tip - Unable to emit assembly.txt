Unable to emit assembly


To sign the assembly manually
Use the Strong Name Tool (Sn.exe) to create a public/private key pair file. 

This file has a .snk extension. 

Delete the COM reference that is generating the error from your project.

From the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, point to Visual Studio Tools, and then click Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt.

Move to the directory where you want to place your assembly wrapper.

Type the following code.
 
	tlbimp <path to COM reference file> /out:<output assembly name> /keyfile:<path to .snk file>
 

Tero's Sample Usage:

	tlbimp c:\windows\system32\shell32.dll /out:c:\temp\Interop.Shell32.dll /keyfile:c:\work\dotnet\_snk\tero.snk
