Can be done. Two ways: 

• Deleteing a tree 

Add a - symbol before the placement. EG: 

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\^DELETE ME] would be 

[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\^DELETE ME] to delete. 

• Deleting a key 

Make the key equal -. EG: 

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\^DELETE ME] would be 
meh=1 

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\^DELETE ME] to delete 
meh=- 

PS - be vary careful with these.
