Process Creation Notification

I am trying to create an application (C#) that can be notified of processes being created through WMI.
I tried to do it using the following code:

WqlEventQuery weq=new WqlEventQuery("SELECT * FROM __InstanceCreationEvent WHERE TargetInstance ISA 'Win32_Process'");mew=new ManagementEventWatcher(new ManagementScope(),weq);
mew.EventArrived+=new EventArrivedEventHandler(ProcessUpdateDetected);mew.Start();

When I do so, I get a COMException.

Unhandled Exception: System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x80042002): Exception from HRESULT: 0x80042002.
   at System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ThrowExceptionForHR(Int32 errorCode, IntPtr errorInfo)
   at System.Management.ManagementEventWatcher.Start()
   at UberTask.Form1.SetupEvents()
   at UberTask.Form1..ctor()
   at UberTask.Form1.Main()
Since there is such little documentation in this area in .NET, any tips would be helpful.
