Integrated Windows Authentication not Enabled 
VB.NET user: I had a problem with my machine and had to uninstall and reinstall IIS (Win XP Pro). I have several VB.Net web apps that were running fine before. Now when I try to compile, I get the error... 

Error while trying to run project: Unable to start debugging on the
web server. Debugging failed because integrated Windows authentication
is not enabled.
I did run aspnet_regiis -i but it did not solve the issue. 

Randy: A very common problem.
