Here is an example of how to create a DataTable that is populated with the tables contained in a database:

Public Function GetTables(ByVal conn As OleDbConnection) As DataTable
   conn.Open()
   Dim schemaTable As DataTable = conn.GetOleDbSchemaTable( _
      OleDbSchemaGuid.Tables, New Object() {Nothing, Nothing, Nothing, "TABLE"})
   conn.Close()
   Return schemaTable
End Function
