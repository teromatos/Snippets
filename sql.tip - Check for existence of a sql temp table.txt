Check for the existence of a sql temp table 
Here's an easy way to check if a temp table exists, before trying to create it (ie. for reusable scripts) from Simon Sabin's post :

IF object_id('tempdb..#MyTempTable') IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
   DROP TABLE #MyTempTable
END

CREATE TABLE #MyTempTable
(
   ID int IDENTITY(1,1),
   SomeValue varchar(100)
)
GO


That way, if you have to change databases in the query window, you don't have to drop the tables before you run it again.

Hello Jason: 
Although Temp tables might come handy sometimes. However, I knew recently that using a table declared as a TABLE Type is much better, especially that you don't need to make sure the temp table is deleted or not, since it will be automatically deleted, here is an example: 

DECLARE @TempTable TABLE 
( 
Id INT, 
Name VARCHAR(50) 
) 

Then you can deal with the table @TempTable similar to any other table, with some limitations, but at least it does what is required from a temp table. 

Hope that helps, 
Regards
