SQL Server: The proper and fastest way to check if rows matching a condition exist 
You wouldn't believe how many times i've seen this code

IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Table1 WHERE ... ) > 0
 

It's understandable though. Logically it's the easiest way to write "if there are any rows matching my condition do this".

But it's also wrong. Plainly and simplly wrong! 

Why?

Because when you do a count(*) there is no way to get around an index range scan or a full table scan. For a large resultset this will be a huge resource hog.

So how do i do this you might ask yourself?

Very simple:  Use EXISTS!

IF EXISTS(SELECT * FROM Table1 WHERE ...) 

Exists stops the execution as soon as it reads the first row, compared to Count which goes through the whole resultset matching our condition. 

 

This may seem as such a trivial tip but EXISTS is so underused even by experienced database developers.

And don't forget the NOT EXISTS to check if rows matching the condition don't exist.

 

SQL Server Product team recognised this problem so in SQL Server 2005 those 2 statements produce same execution plans whenever possible.

However relying on some internal "maybe when it suits me" operation is not good practice in my book.
