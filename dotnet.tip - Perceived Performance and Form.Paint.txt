Original tip is below

also we can use the following in the Form_Load event

        Me.Show()
        Application.DoEvents()
	'-- call to long method here



1   Private IsFirstPaint As Boolean = True  
2   
3     Private Sub DoWork()   
4         Cursor = Cursors.WaitCursor   
5         StatusBar1.Text = "Loading..."  
6         System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(2000)   
7         For i As Integer = 0 To 99   
8             ComboBox1.Items.Add("ComboBoxItem " & i)   
9             System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(5)   
10         Next  
11         ComboBox1.SelectedIndex = 4   
12         System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(2000)   
13         For i As Integer = 0 To 99   
14             ListBox1.Items.Add("ListBoxItem " & i)   
15             System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(5)   
16         Next  
17         ListBox1.SelectedIndex = 4   
18         StatusBar1.Text = "Ready."  
19         Cursor = Cursors.Default  
20     End Sub  
21   
22     Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, _   
23       ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load   
24         DoWork()   
25     End Sub  
26   
27     Private Sub Form1_Paint(ByVal sender As Object, _   
28       ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs) _   
29       Handles MyBase.Paint   
30         If IsFirstPaint Then  
31             IsFirstPaint = False  
32             Application.DoEvents()   
33             DoWork()   
34         End If  
35     End Sub  



Just answered my own question. DoEvents and Refresh do nothing until the form is visible. So how about this.Show() in Form_Load? I tested it, and it appears to do the same thing as the Form_Paint solution above, and it's only one line of code.

The only problem that I see is that there may be some way to load a form without showing it, although I don't know of any. This "trick" would affect that. I would say that the this.Show() solution would work for most, if not all situations.

Interesting. That does appear to work, and the debugger picks up the correct line of code in Load() exceptions, too.

So, the moral of the story is:

Always call this.Show() in the Form_Load event?

I'll have to go back and add this to my last project. There are several instances where a dialog will appear after a few seconds of waiting, causing the user to usually try to open it 2 or 3 times.

I wouldn't say "always" because we don't know if there are any side-effects yet. But yes, if you have a form that does a few seconds (or more) worth of work, I'd say try one of the Paint() or Load() DoEvents techniques first as a quick easy solution. If you need *real* threaded background processing, then look into the BackgroundWorker solution.

Anyway definitely try it and post your feedback here. I'd try it in our project but that's in offshore mode now. I'm disinclined to make a bunch of sweeping changes in the way we display forms..
