I came across this somewhere (I can’t remember where, think it was while googling for something else), but it’s rather handy.

At the login dialog on Mac OS X, if no one is logged in, you can type ’>console’ to drop out of the GUI environment into a plain text console. Since virtually nothing is loaded at this point it makes a nicer alternative to the single user login for poking around when trouble calls.
