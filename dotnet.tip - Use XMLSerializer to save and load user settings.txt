Using the XMLSettings class is very basic

When you want to save settings, first create your settings class with the variables you need in your program. Make sure it has a parameterless contructer as serialization can't serialize without. Give it the path to your xml file, and make sure all folders are created. Then pass your settings class also

//Save
XMLSettings<MySettings>.Save(XMLPath, Settings); 

When loading, the Load method simply returns your type, just pass the xmlpath to the method and voila!

//Load
setting = XMLSettings<MySettings>.Load(XMLPath); 




using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using System.Xml.Serialization;
using System.IO;

namespace XMLSerializationSettings
{
    public static class XMLSettings<T>
    {
        public static T Load(string XMLPath)
        {
            //Load settings and return our type

            T temp;

            XmlSerializer DeSerializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(T));
            TextReader reader = new StreamReader(XMLPath);
            temp = (T)DeSerializer.Deserialize(reader);
            reader.Close();

            return temp;
        }

        public static void Save(string XMLPath, T settings)
        {
            //Save settings to xml using our type

            XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(T));
            TextWriter writer = new StreamWriter(XMLPath);
            serializer.Serialize(writer, settings);
            writer.Close();
        }
    }
}
