GridView Delete LinkButton Confirmation Update
 
Well, as commonly happens I put up the first post and realized that that solution didn't cover everything.

Like the fact that when I clicked on the edit button rather that the delete button I ended up with errors.

So here is the corrected code that should not cause any problems. As a matter of fact, I think this solution opens up a lot more possibilities.

Anyway, if you want a formatted version you can get it by clicking on the title of this post. That will take you to a share google docs that has the code in it.

Below is a copy as well.

==============================================================
protected void GridView1_RowCreated(object sender, GridViewRowEventArgs e)
{
if (e.Row.RowType == DataControlRowType.DataRow)
{
foreach (DataControlFieldCell myCell in e.Row.Cells)
{
foreach (Control myControl in myCell.Controls)
{
switch(myControl.GetType().ToString())
{
case "System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataControlLinkButton":
LinkButton myLinkButton = (LinkButton)myControl;
switch(myLinkButton.CommandName)
{
case "Delete":
myLinkButton.Attributes["onclick"] = "if(confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this record?')==false){return false;}";
break;
case "Edit":
break;
case "Update":
break;
case "Cancel":
break;
default:
break;
}
break;
case "System.Web.UI.WebControls.HyperLink":
break;
case "System.Web.UI.WebControls.TextBox":
break;
default:
break;
}
}
}
}
}
