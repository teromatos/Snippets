When you are trying to connect or access from a Database table which is having large volume of data (more than a lakh), query execution time will be more.

The error ( Timeout expired. The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding.) occurs when the execution time crosses Timeout Property.

There are two main Timeout property in ADO.NET.

1. Connection Timeout for Connection
2. Timeout for Data Access( Command Object or DataAdapter)

The Former, could be solved by setting ConnectionTimeout Property of Connection object either in on Connection String.

This string will make a connection object to wait 400 seconds to get connected to the database.

Even after this, you may still get the same.
Because this property will set timeout only to Connection object.
So it will wait for xxx seconds for the connection to the database.


2.If this error Timeout Expired still persists, then it is not with the Timeout property of Connection object instead it is with Data Provider objects say in DataAdapter or Command Object

To overcome this , set cmd.CommandTimeout='0'(Zero) which makes adapter or command to wait for indefinite time before terminating the attempt to execute a command and generating an error.
