1. Install the program as u would normally, then start the program.
2. You'll see a menu at the top, and pictograms beneath it.
3. First we have to make a new user account, goto the pictogram bar and click user accounts (the pictogram with 1 head on it).
4. When u click on that a new menu pops up, goto the far right of that menu and you'l see "user accounts" right click in the white empty space,
and select "add", and enter a new account name.
5. Then when u returned to the main menu you'l see under setup some basic options which u can set.

The login name you use to access you're ftp
---Password---
The password for the ftp server it generates a random 1 but u can change it for anything else

Best to leave that empty

When u did all that goto access rights and right click in the white plane, select "Add" and select the map u wish to run ure FTP in.
When done look at the right you will see some options you can check or uncheck, i'll explain themem.
