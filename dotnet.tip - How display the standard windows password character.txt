Standard Windows Password Character 
I was writing a login form for an application I'm working on and I decided I didn't want to use the standard '*' as my password character. I wanted to use the black circle (%CF), the same one that windows login uses. I figured out what the Unicode value for it was (0x25CF) and then I tried to set that as the password character for my textbox through the designer but no luck it would only take standard ASCII characters. So I decided to set in my form constructor, like:

this.txtPassword.PasswordChar = '\u25CF';

Which worked so now when the user types in their password the see '%CF' as opposed to '*'. I just figured I would pass this along incase anyone else wants to do the same. I don't know if the same kind of thing will work in ASP.NET or not but it would be cool to find out.

UPDATE: It appears that the new textbox in .NET 2.0 contains a property UseSystemPasswordChar, that when set will make it use the system password character and literally treat it as a standard windows password textbox. Thanks to David Kean for pointint this out.
