Verifying if a connection to SQL Server is Encrypted

If you do not have a network parser such as netmon and want to verify if the connection from the client to the SQL server is encrypted, the following query can be utilised:


SELECT encrypt_option 
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections 
WHERE session_id = @@SPID

-- Note: remove the WHERE clause to see all connections.
