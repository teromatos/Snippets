Scenario: I have 2 tables.

1st Table - "SystemRoles" has 2 columns, Name and Description. Name is the Prim. Key.
2nd Table - "SystemUserRoles" has 2 columns also. UserName and RoleName. Together those 2 columns make up a composite Prim. Key. This table's data keep track of users and the roles they are members of.

I want to write a query that will return a result set with 3 columns. Name and Description from SystemRoles and a "MemberCount" column that, for each role, tells me the number of users in that role as found in the SystemUserRoles table. The tricky part is that I need a zero in the MemberCount column of the result set if no users are currently a member for any given role. So I think a simple inner join is out of the question based on that requirement.


SELECT 
r.Name, r.Description, COUNT(u.RoleName) 
FROM 
SystemRoles r 
LEFT JOIN 
SystemUserRoles u 
ON r.Name = u.RoleName 
GROUP BY 
r.Name, r.Description
