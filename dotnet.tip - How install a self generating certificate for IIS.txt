Obtain the Certificate Creation Tool (Makecert.exe) 
Option #1:
Search your PC and see if you can find the file "makecert.exe".
(ie: C:\i387\files\pfiles\msoffice\office10)
If you don't find one, you can get the file from a .NET SDK install.
ie: 
C:\Program Files\Microsoft.NET\SDK\v2.0\Bin
or 
C:\Program Files\Microsoft.NET\SDK\v1.1\Bin 
Option #2:
Download and install the "Platform Software Development Kit (SDK)" from Microsoft which will contain the Certificate Creation Tool (Makecert.exe) which is in the \bin folder.
