Macro To Update References Of All Projects In A Solution
By Doug Doedens

When working in enterprise development there are occasions when you have a solution file with 10 or more projects in it all using private assemblies. When a low level assembly's location changes you end up with a solution file with 10 or more broken references. The macro listed below is designed to save you from the pain staking task of fixing each reference one by one. When the macro listed below is run it will display a window file dialog at which point you will point to the new location of the assembly. Next the macro will walk through each project file and update the reference to the assembly you choose if there is one. 

In order to run the macro you need to navigate to the "TOOLS" menu and choose macro IDE. Next choose File --> Add New Item . From the dialog screen choose a new module. Finally cut and paste the entire code listed below inside the code window overwriting the default module framework that is listed.
