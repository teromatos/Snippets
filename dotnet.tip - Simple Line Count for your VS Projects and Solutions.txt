Simple Line Count for your VS Projects and Solutions. 
 
Compile this code as a Console app, put the Exe in your path.  Then when inside one of your Project directories, just type linecount to see all the lines in all *.cs files in your project dir and all subdirectories.  This does not figure out if  each .cs is actually included in your project or not, but I guess that could be added.  There may be some macro you could do inside VS, if so, please let me know.

using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using System.IO;

namespace LineCount
{
    class Program
    {
        static int totalCount = 0;

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string path = Environment.CurrentDirectory;
            DirectoryInfo di = new DirectoryInfo(path);
            Console.WriteLine("Line count for all *.cs files in current directory and all subdirectories.");
            ShowProjectLineCount(di);
            Console.WriteLine("Total Project Count: {0}", totalCount);
        }

        public static void ShowProjectLineCount(DirectoryInfo d)
        {
            // Curr dir.
            FileInfo[] fis = d.GetFiles("*.cs");
            foreach ( FileInfo fi in fis )
            {
                using ( StreamReader sr = fi.OpenText() )
                {
                    string line;
                    int lineCount = 0;
                    while ( (line = sr.ReadLine()) != null )
                    {
                        lineCount++;
                    }
                    totalCount += lineCount;
                    Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}", lineCount, fi.FullName);
                    lineCount = 0;
                }
            }
            // Subdirectories.
            DirectoryInfo[] dis = d.GetDirectories();
            foreach ( DirectoryInfo di in dis )
            {
                ShowProjectLineCount(di);
            }
        }
    }
}
