How to enable attachments in Outlook
====================================

 
I get asked this by at least one person about once a week as I seem to have an uncanny knack for remembering long registry strings ;)

To stop outlook from blocking attachments, open up Regedit.

In Regedit, navigate to HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\x\Outlook\Security

for X put the numeric version number of your version of outlook - for outlook XP use 10.0, for outlook 2003 use 11.0

Create a new string called Level1Remove (Case Sensitive)

For the string value, add whatever file extensions you want to allow (including the dot) seperated by colons e.g. .exe;.lnk
