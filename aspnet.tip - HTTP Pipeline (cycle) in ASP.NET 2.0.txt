HTTP Pipeline in ASP.NET 2.0

Here is a quick reference for the steps in HTTP pipeline in ASP.NET 2.0.  Some of the steps are internal (cannot be subscribed by HTTP modules or GLOBAL.ASAX):

   1. Internal step to validate request.  Protects against malicious attacks exploiting path canonicalization
   2. Internal step to perform URL mapping (if the URL mapping feature is enabled)
   3. Fire BeginRequest event
   4. Fire AuthenticateRequest event
   5. Fire DefaultAuthentication internal event
   6. Fire PostAuthenticateRequest event
   7. Fire AuthorizeRequest event
   8. Fire PostAuthorizeRequest event
   9. Fire ResolveRequestCache event
  10. Fire PostResolveRequestCache event
  11. Internal step to determine the IHttpHandler to process the current request (this is when the page compilation takes place)
  12. Fire PostMapRequestHandler event
  13. Fire AcquireRequestState event
  14. Fire PostAcquireRequestState event
  15. Fire PreRequestHandlerExecute event
  16. Internal step to execute the IHttpHandler (call its ProcessRequest method) for the current request. The handler is determined at step #11
  17. Fire PostRequestHandlerExecute event
  18. Fire ReleaseRequestState event
  19. Fire PostReleaseRequestState event
  20. Internal step to perform response filtering (only if HttpResponse.Filter is installed)
  21. Fire UpdateRequestCache event
  22. Fire PostUpdateRequestCache event
  23. Fire EndRequest event.  This is the only event that is guaranteed to be fired for each request

I got this list from http://blogs.msdn.com/dmitryr/ - it was part of another topic, but I thought it had value by itself.
