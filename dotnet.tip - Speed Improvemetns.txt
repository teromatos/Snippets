methodinvoker (no args), synchronous
Waitcallback  (no args), asynchronous
public event OnClick as EventHandler (system defined delegate)

Use for i = 0 to 10 when dealing with strings (faster), for objects either "for i " or "for each"

use datareader (faster)
use connection pool
use binary when comparing text
use i += 1 instead of i = i + 1 (easier on the compiler)
