Use the Strong Name Tool (Sn.exe) to create a public/private key pair file. 
This file has a .snk extension. 

Delete from your project the COM reference that is generating the error. 
From the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003, point to Visual Studio .NET Tools, and then click Visual Studio .NET Command Prompt. 
Move to the directory where you want to place your assembly wrapper. 
Type the following: 
tlbimp <path to COM reference file> /out:<output assembly name> /keyfile:<path to .snk file>
For example: 

tlbimp c:\windows\system32\msi.dll /out:Interop.WindowsInstaller.dll /keyfile:"c:\documents and settings\mykey.snk"
Be sure to use quotes if a path or file contains spaces. 

in Visual Studio .NET, add a .NET Assembly reference to the file you just created. 

C:\WORK\VB.NET\App\SQLDocumenter\Current\obj\Interop.SQLDMO.dll
