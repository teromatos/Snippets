I'm getting tested on regular expressions in VB.NET today so here is yet another regex cheatsheet:

. = one character 
[abc] =  a, b or c 
[ae][ea] = ae, aa, ee, or ea 
[^x] = not x

^ = when not contained in [] signifies the start of a string 
$ = when not conatined in [] signifies the end of a string 
* = zero or more of the previous character or regular expression 
+ = one or more of the previous character or regular expression 
? = zero or one of the previous character or regular expression

{n}= match previous character or expression exactly n times 
{m,n} = match previous character or expression at least m and no more than n times 
{n,} = match previous character or expression at least n times

( ) = create subexpressions within in parentheses for use with *, +, ? or { }

| = or

\w = word character, letter or digit 
\W = anything but \w 
\s = space character 
\S = anything but \s 
\d = any digit 
\D = anything but \d
