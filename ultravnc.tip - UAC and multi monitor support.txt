Setup UltraVNC in Windows XP to allow Ctrl-Alt-Del

On a Win 7 machine, you must have UAC on. Keep it on the default setting. Next, have the PC logged in and unlocked.
Remote into it with Ultravnc. Hit the button to send ctl alt delete command. 
You will see 2 popup messages, one I think is the UAC prompt, the other asks if you want to let ultravnc make changes to the registry. 
Say yes to all the popups. Now hit the ctl alt delete button again and you'll see the Win 7 PC at the lock/switch user/logoff etc. screen. 
You can now send ctl alt delete commands to it whether it is locked/logged off or unlocked.
