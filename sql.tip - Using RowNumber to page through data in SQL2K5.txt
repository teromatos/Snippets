Easy way to page data in Sql Server

SELECT *, Row_Number() over (ORDER BY FirstName) AS RowNumber 
FROM Customer
WHERE RowNumber > 1000 AND RowNumber < 1051
ORDER BY FirstName


So then, use a WITH statement to construct a CTE: 
WITH __actualSet 
( 
SELECT C.*, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY CompanyName ASC) AS RowNumber FROM Customers C 
ORDER BY RowNumber ASC 
) SELECT * FROM __actualSet WHERE RowNumber BETWEEN 1 AND 10
