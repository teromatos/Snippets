Launch "Finder" - "Applications" - "Utilities" - "Disk Utility".

Insert the source CD-ROM (which ISO image should be created) into the CD/DVD-ROM drive on your Mac.

Select that CD/DVD-ROM drive from the Disk Utility device list.

Click the "New Image" button on the top of the Disk Utility window.

Choose name and location for the image (you can leave the default settings).

Set "Image Format" to "read-only".

Click "Save" and wait for the image creation process to finish.

Locate the created image, open its pop-up menu (by Ctrl+clicking the file) and select "Get Info" from the pop-up menu.

Expand "Name & Extension" section and change file's extension from ".dmg" to ".iso".

Now you should be able to connect this image to virtual machine’s CD/DVD-ROM drive: launch Parallels Desktop for Mac, click on the "CD/DVD-ROM" in the main configuration window to open the settings, choose the "Use image file" option, click the browse (“…”) button to locate the ISO image file.

======================================================

Create a folder with the contents you want on your ISO.

Open Disk Utility and use the New Image from Folder menu item to create an image. Ensure it is uncompressed and use the CD/DVD master option.

In my experience this creates HFS+ masters which are no good in Windows.

Open the Terminal

Assuming your new image is called ~/Desktop/Master.cdr (the file is on your desktop and called Master.cdr) type:


Code:
cd ~/Desktop
hdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -o Master.iso Master.cdrThis will create an ISO/Joliet .iso file.
