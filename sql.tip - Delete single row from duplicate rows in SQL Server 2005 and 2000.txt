Delete single row from duplicate rows in SQL Server 2005 and 2000
July 23, 2007 by chiragrdarji 

        Lets assume that you are using SQL Server 2005 for your current project. You found that you have few rows which have duplicate data in all the columns. Lets consider that you have table name “Example” which has two columns ID and Name. 

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Example]
(
[ID] [int] NOT NULL,
[Name] [nvarchar](50) COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS NULL
) 
ON [PRIMARY]

Fig - (1) Create Statement for Table

    Lets assume that you have following data in Example table.
    
ID  Name
1   Chirag
1   Chirag
2   Sahilesh
3   Dipak
4   Mihir
4   Mihir
4   Piyush 

Fig - (2) Data in Example table.

      You can see that first two and last three rows are duplicate rows. All the values in these rows are same.  Here is the insert script, if you want to do this practically in your local database.

INSERT INTO [Example] ([ID],[Name]) VALUES (1,Chirag)
INSERT INTO [Example] ([ID],[Name]) VALUES (1,Chirag)
INSERT INTO [Example] ([ID],[Name]) VALUES (2,‘Shailesh’)
INSERT INTO [Example] ([ID],[Name]) VALUES (3,‘Dipak’)
INSERT INTO [Example] ([ID],[Name]) VALUES (4,‘Mihir’)
INSERT INTO [Example] ([ID],[Name]) VALUES (4,‘Mihir’)
INSERT INTO [Example] ([ID],[Name]) VALUES (4,‘Piyush’) 

Fig - (2) Insert Script. 

       Now you want to delete duplicate rows in such a way that only one row will be exist after delete statement. First let me write the query which will give return all the duplicate rows from table. 

SELECT 
        [ID],[NAME],COUNT([ID])
FROM
        [Example]
GROUP BY
        [ID],[NAME]
HAVING
        COUNT([ID]) > 1 

Fig - (3) Query to identify duplicate rows in table. 

       Here I have used COUNT([ID]) in select statement as ID is not null filed. You can use any column which is not NULL. If all the columns in your table allows NULL value than you can use COUNT(*). The Difference between COUNT(Column Name) and COUNT(*) is, if your column allows null value and in table you have 5 records with 2 null values in ColumnA. If you use COUNT(ColumnA) it will returns 3 and if you use COUNT(*) it will returns 5. So COUNT(Column Name) ignores NULL value. Lets get back to our query. I have used all the column in SELECT and GROUP BY clause. You also have to write all the columns of your table in SELECT and GROUP BY clause. This way you can identify all the duplicates row from table. 

        Lets assume that you have to delete the row which has value (1, ‘Chirag’) so that only one row remains. Here is the query, (Note: This will work only in SQL Sever 2005) 

      DELETE TOP(1) FROM [Example] WHERE [ID] = 1 

Fig - (3) Delete single row from duplicate rows. 

          Here I have used TOP(1) , If you have n rows which has all the values same than you have to use TOP(n-1) so that only 1 row will be remain after delete statement. To delete all the duplicate rows you need to write a cursor as shown below, 

DECLARE @ID int
DECLARE @NAME NVARCHAR(50)
DECLARE @COUNT int 

DECLARE CUR_DELETE CURSOR FOR
SELECT [ID],[NAME],COUNT([ID]) FROM [Example] GROUP BY [ID],[NAME] HAVING COUNT([ID]) > 1 

OPEN CUR_DELETE 

FETCH NEXT FROM CUR_DELETE INTO @ID,@NAME,@COUNT
/* Loop through cursor for remaining ID */
WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN 

DELETE TOP(@COUNT -1) FROM [Example] WHERE ID = @ID 

FETCH NEXT FROM CUR_DELETE INTO @ID,@NAME,@COUNT
END 

CLOSE CUR_DELETE
DEALLOCATE CUR_DELETE 

Fig - (4) Cursor to delete all duplicate  records 

         This is all about deleting duplicate rows in SQL Server 2005. 

       Now to do the same in SQL server 2000.  There is function called ROWCOUNT in SQL.  I have used same [Example] table. You can do this by,

SET ROWCOUNT 1
DELETE FROM [Example] WHERE [ID] = 1 

Fig - (5) Delete duplicate row in SQL Server 2000

      ROWCOUNT function specify that how many rows will be affected by the statement which is immediately written below.  Here also you have to write  ROWCOUNT (n -1) to delete n duplicate rows such that only  1 row will remain in database.

Happy Programming !!

This demonstrates good usage of RowCount.
However to delete duplicate row, I prefer following solution, which works with all version without any issues.

Gr8 thing..

Also can be done by altering the table to create an identity column and then deleting the rows except 1.

Here is another solution for SQL Server 2005,

WITH

Test AS (SELECT ROW_NUMBER () OVER ( PARTITION BY ID, FNAME , LNAME ORDER BY ID) AS A FROM tbl1 ) DELETE FROM Test WHERE A > 1

Consider that My Table is having structure as follows
Col1 - ObjectName
Col2 - PriceValue

for Example my records are like
ObjectName PriceValue
—————————————-
A 20
A 50
B 10
B 30
C 50

How can I get the difference (Variance) between ObjectName.

I have tried and getting output with SUM Value using Group by clause as,

A 70
B 40
C 50

But i need the difference between each two row based on Group By ObjectName as.

A -30
B -20
C 50

Would you help me in solving this issue.

Thanks in Advance

Cheers,
 raghav

Just curious!

Hi all

i don’t think using cursors would be the good option to delete duplicate records. 

this can be achieved easily by another query. i am saying this because it slower down the process when it comes to delete duplicate records in table contains 1000s of records.

John Spencer,

Why not try a MIN (FIELD) function call to isolate the minimum value you would like to retain and then exclude that value from the delete statement?

??
