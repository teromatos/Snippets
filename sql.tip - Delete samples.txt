/* SQL-92-Standard subquery */
USE pubs
DELETE FROM titleauthor
WHERE title_id IN 
   (SELECT title_id 
   FROM titles
   WHERE title LIKE '%computers%')

/* Transact-SQL extension */
USE pubs
DELETE titleauthor
FROM titleauthor INNER JOIN titles 
   ON titleauthor.title_id = titles.title_id
WHERE titles.title LIKE '%computers%'

E. Use DELETE and a SELECT with the TOP Clause
Because a SELECT statement can be specified in a DELETE statement, the TOP clause can also be used within the SELECT statement. For example, this example deletes the top 10 authors from the authors table.

DELETE authors 
FROM (SELECT TOP 10 * FROM authors) AS t1
WHERE authors.au_id = t1.au_id
