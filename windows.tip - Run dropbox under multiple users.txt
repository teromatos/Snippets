I found some post in another place which describes a solution.

First, run the Dropbox installer using the command line switch /D=C:\Program Files\Dropbox (with no quotes) to install Dropbox into the Program Files directory for all users.

Then here an updated version of the procedure given on this link:

Since Dropbox will normally only work when a user is logged in, we will have to install and use it first via remote desktop, before it can be turned it into a Service.

Remote desktop to your WHS as administrator
Get DropBox from their website.
Install and configure Dropbox as you like. e.g. I made a special share on my WHS named Dropbox before the installation and linked Dropbox to this share. Then exit dropbox from the system tray.
Similar to Foldershare, you will need instsrv.exe and srvany.exe from the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools.
Copy instsrv.exe to C:\Program Files\Dropbox
Copy srvany.exe to C:\Program Files\Dropbox
execute "C:\Program Files\Dropbox\instsrv.exe" Dropbox "C:\Program Files\Dropbox\srvany.exe"
execute reg ADD HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dropbox\Parameters /v Application /d "C:\Program Files\Dropbox\Dropbox.exe"
execute reg ADD HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dropbox\Parameters /v AppDirectory /d "C:\Program Files\Dropbox"
Delete or move the shorcut to Dropbox away from the startfolder (Start -> All Programs -> Startup) on the startmenu.
Move (cut/paste) ALL the files from C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application Data\DropBox to C:\Documents and Settings\Default User\Application Data\Dropbox
execute net start Dropbox

One step to add: As Dropbox installs into Application data, you need to create the folder c:\program files\dropbox and copy all files from the Dropbox\bin directory to it – Michael Stum Dec 30 '09 at 3:29
Is there a similar version for Windows Server 2008? – Jaco Pretorius Jun 8 at 10:03
I managed to get this working (Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit) using this article social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winserverMigration/… - I didn't need to use instsrv.exe - just srvany.exe pointing to Dropbox – Jaco Pretorius Jun 14 at 14:12
I use TaskScheduler and start Dropbox when system start. Work like a charm. :) – dario-g Aug 18 at 12:12
